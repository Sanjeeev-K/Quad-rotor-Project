# Quad-rotor-Project
RBE501 Robot Dynamics Project - Path Planning module

In this module, we make use the repository from github.com/motion-planning as a base. On top of that, we add functionalities for multi-point navigation and more robust obstacle avoidance for a quad-rotor.

Instructions for use:

1. Download/Gitclone the directory from here : https://github.com/motion-planning/rrt-algorithms into a single folder, say rrt-algorithms.

2. Once the downloaded folder(rrt-algorithms) is ready, navigate to rrt-algorithms/examples/rrt-star and paste all the files from here in there.

3. Once all files are pasted, run the file test1.py to observe results of the path planner.


Tools required : Web Browser to display results, Python to run code
